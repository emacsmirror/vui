* Unreleased

** Added

- Optional docstring support in =defcomponent= macro.

** Fixed

- Propagate indent through =hstack= to nested =vstack=. When a =vstack= was nested inside an =hstack=, the indent context from parent =vstacks= was lost, causing subsequent lines to render without proper indentation.
- Accumulate indent correctly in nested =vstacks=.
